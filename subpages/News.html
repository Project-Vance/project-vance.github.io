			<p>Lead Dev Qsader here, I haven't made a GameBanana update in a while but I want to talk about Vance and what is happening internally.
			I would like to first say that we have done much work to Vance in the past 4 and a half months though there has been chaos within the team
			I want to talk about today.</p>
			
			<div class="row pt-3">
			
			<p>Vance devs have become more divided than ever, Brandy otherwise known as Manimal who was the previous lead dev of the Vance team
has taken away my ModDB access and access to the GitLab. He thinks that my team should become a "Revival Project". I do not agree
with this as he has allowed us to continue what has been started and we have made great progress as a team. If you are worried that Vance
is going to be cancelled don't worry about it because im not going down without a fight. I was planning on switching to GitHub for the project
though I have to pay to move over the project so I have decided as developers we will be using atlassian software, the project is now under
BitBucket rather than GitLab. As with the ModDB I have got a replacement for it and that is a website hosted under GitHub as our home page
for Vance related updates and announcements. The Vance site needs some work but it is looking good so far, to ensure productivity within
our team we are now having team meetings every 1-2 days which is something I should have done in the first place as lead dev of the Vance
Team.</p>

			<p>This has only just begun and we are not going to let it fall into the abyss of failure so easily, if you would like to help us out please DM me
at <b>Qsader#2463</b> on Discord.</p>

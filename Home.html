				<h1>Welcome To The Project VλNCE Website!</h1>
				
				<p>Project VλNCE is a total conversion Half-Life 2 mod from the
				perspective of Alyx, set in an alternate universe where
				Gordon Freeman declined G-Man's offer at the end of
				Half-Life 1, and is presumed dead. Play through a unique
				take on the events of Half-Life 2 with new and improved
				environments, gameplay, combat, graphics, voice
				acting, and more. This is a continuation on the cancelled
				mod "Vance". </p>
